# Asus-Merlin-Research

In this repo I am starting to upload the vast amount of research I have completed on AsusWRT routers, fixes, scripts, and optimizations to bring about best stability and features. The overall goal is to have a feature rich powerful router, comparible along the lines of DDWRT, with great stability. Plus, this has been a fun endeavor and I've learned a lot. You may be seeing me start to even recompile Merlin.NG or the kernels. We'll see.
